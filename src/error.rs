//! Transition Errors are returned by failure paths caused by invalid input in [transition functions](crate::transition),
//! for processes hosting the runtime to differentiate between failure modes.
//!
//! They are more granular than [ExitCodeV1]/[ExitCodeV2] which are included in the block transaction receipts.
