//! Construct to facilitate state management and gas value handling for smart contract calls.
//!
//! The [ContractInstance] struct, which is initialized during the [smart contract call process](crate::commands::account::call),
//! orchestrates [TransitionContext] to ensure accurate state preservation during and after contract execution.
//! While it does not actively manage gas usage, it reads and passes on the value of any remaining gas after execution.
