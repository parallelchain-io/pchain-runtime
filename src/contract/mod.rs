//! Defines types and functions that provide a convenient and succinct object-oriented interface for loading,
//! deploying, getting information about, and executing Wasm smart contracts.
//!
//! A contract consists of a Wasm [module] that contains one or more guest functions.
//! It should match the current [version][cbi_version] of Contract Binary Interface ([cbi](cbi_host_functions)) and is free to use functionality provided by the [host](host_functions).
//! The state transition function prepares the execution [context] and builds an [instance] of the contract.
