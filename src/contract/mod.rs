//! contract defines types and functions that provide a convenient and succinct object-oriented interface for loading,
//! deploying, getting information about, and executing (WASM) smart contracts inside Executor and else where. 
//! 
//! A contract consists of a set of host functions that can be compiled into WASM [module]. The state transition 
//! function prepares execution [context] and builds an [instance] from a contract with with well-defined [functions].
//! The contract should matche with the current [version] of Contract Binary Interface ([cbi]),
