//! Defines types and functions that provide a convenient and succinct object-oriented interface for loading,
//! deploying, getting information about, and executing (WASM) smart contracts.
//!
//! A contract consists of a set of host functions that can be compiled into WASM [module]. The state transition
//! function prepares execution [context] and builds an [instance] from a contract with well-defined [functions].
//! The contract should match the current [version] of Contract Binary Interface ([cbi]).
