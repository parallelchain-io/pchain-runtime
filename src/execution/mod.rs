//! Handles execution of [state](state) transition functions and view calls.
//!
//! This module provides the core functionality for [executing commands](execute_commands) that facilitate state transitions, which are triggered by submitting a transaction.
//! It also manages [view calls](execute_view), which are used for read-only access to the blockchain state.
//! While view calls follow similar execution logic as state transitions, they are distinct in that they do not result in any state modification.
//! This design allows for a consistent approach to both state-altering transactions and non-modifying view calls.
