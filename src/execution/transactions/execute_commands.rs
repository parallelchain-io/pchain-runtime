//! Implementation of execution process on a sequence of Commands. The process starts from Pre-Charge phase,
//! and then goes into Commands Phases, and finally Charge Phase.
//!
//! Processes include execution of:
//! - [Commands](pchain_types::blockchain::Command) from a transaction (Account Command and Staking Command).
//! - [View call](https://github.com/parallelchain-io/parallelchain-protocol/blob/master/Contracts.md#view-calls).
//! - [Next Epoch](pchain_types::blockchain::Command::NextEpoch) Command.
//!
//! ### Executing Commands from a Transaction
//!
//! It is the normal flow of a transaction. Firstly, basic checking is performed and
//! cancel the execution if it fails, and Balance of signer is deducted beforehand (Pre-Charge).
//!
//! Then Commands are encapsulated into `Command Tasks`. Each command task is an item in
//! a stack. Execution order starts from the top item. When [Call](pchain_types::blockchain::Command::Call)
//! Command is executed successfully with `Deferred Command`, the Deferred Commands are then
//! encapsulated into Command Task and put to the stack. This stack model allows the Deferred Command
//! to be executed right after its parent Call Command in the same way other commands do.
//!
//! Each command task completes with a [Command Receipt](pchain_types::blockchain::CommandReceipt). If
//! it fails, the process aborts and then goes to Charge Phase immediately.
//!
//! Finally in the Charge Phase, the signer balance is adjusted according to the gas used. Some fees are also
//! transferred to Proposer and Treasury.
//!
//! ### Executing a View Call
//!
//! View Call means execution of a contract by calling its view-only methods. There is not Pre-Charge Phase nor
//! Charge Phase. The gas used in the resulting command receipt is only catered for the gas consumption of this
//! contract call.
//!
//! ### Executing Next Epoch Command
//!
//! Next Epoch Command is a special command that does not go through Pre-Charge Phase or Charge Phase, but
//! will modify the state and update signers nonce. Its goal is to compute the resulting state of
//! Network Account and return changes to a validator set for next epoch in [TransitionResult].
