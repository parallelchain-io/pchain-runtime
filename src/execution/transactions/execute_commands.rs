// TODO 1 - better phrase this

//! Module for managing the lifecycle and execution strategy of the Account or Staking commands.
//
//! These commands are sent by users in a signed transaction,
//! and are executed in accordance to a lifecycle briefly described below.
//! The [CommandStrategy] trait encapsulates strategies for handling different
//! versions of command execution.
//!
//! ### Lifecycle
//! A brief description of the lifecycle is as follows:
//!
//! Firstly, the transaction undergoes validation during the Pre-Charge phase.
//! The execution is cancelled if these checks fail.
//! If the checks pass, the transaction signer's balance will be deducted upfront according to the specified gas limit.
//!
//! Next, Commands are encapsulated into `Command Tasks`. Each command task is an item in
//! a stack. Execution order starts from the top item. When a [Call](pchain_types::blockchain::Command::Call)
//! Command is executed successfully and outputs `Deferred Commands`, these Deferred Commands will be
//! encapsulated into Command Tasks and pushed onto stack. This stack model allows the Deferred Command
//! to be executed sequentially after its parent Call Command.
//!
//! Each Command Task completes with a Command Receipt. If execution fails,
//! the process aborts and then proceeds immediately to the Charge Phase.
//! Alternatively, the subsequent Command Task will
//! be executed until all Tasks are completed.
//!
//! Finally in the Charge Phase, the Signer's balance will be refunded according to the actual gas used.
//! Some fees are also transferred to Proposer and Treasury.
