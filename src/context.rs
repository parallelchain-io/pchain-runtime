//! Represents an intermediary providing access to the [World State](pchain_world_state) and components that can mutate it.
//!
//! As a singleton instance encapsulating the World State, only a single 'valid' instance of
//! [TransitionContext] can exist at any given time to maintain state integrity.
//! It forms an integral part of larger constructs, such as the [ExecutionState](crate::execution::state::ExecutionState).
//!
//! When used during [contract](crate::contract) execution, the context also maintains intermediate metadata such as
//! deferred commands generated during execution and metadata of the contract instance.
