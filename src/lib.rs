//! ParallelChain Mainnet Runtime is a **State Transition Function** to transit from an input state of the blockchain to next state.
//! It is also the sole system component to execute smart contracts written in Rust by using
//! ParallelChain Smart Contract Development Kit (SDK).
//!
//! ```text
//! f(WS, BD, TX) -> (WS', R)
//!
//! WS = World state represented by set of key-value pairs
//! BD = Blockchain Data
//! TX = Transaction, which is essentially a sequence of Commands
//! R = Receipt, which is a sequence of Command Receipts correspondingly.
//! ```
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! // prepare world state (ws), transaction (tx), and blockchain data (bd),
//! // and call transition.
//! let result = pchain_runtime::Runtime::new().transition(ws, tx, bd);
//! ```
//!
//! In summary, a state [transition] function takes in Transaction, Blockchain and World State to [execute](execution),
//! and outputs a transition result which could be success or [error]. The transition follows
//! the data [types] definitions of ParallelChain Mainnet and the [formulas] in this library.
//! The underlying WebAssembly runtime for transiting state through smart [contract] execution is [wasmer],
//! which is gas-metered, and the [gas] cost incurred will be record in a receipt.
